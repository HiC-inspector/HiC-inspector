In this directory you should place subdirectories with pre-built Bowtie genome indexes (http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net)
For example, some of the files are:

hg19/hg19.1.ebwt
hg19/hg19.2.ebwt
hg19/hg19.3.ebwt
hg19/hg19.4.ebwt
hg19/hg19.rev.1.ebwt
hg19/hg19.rev.2.ebwt

If rd (restrictiondir) is not set, you can place necessary restriction enzyme processed index files there as well. 
For example, for hindIII processing:

hg19/hindIII.hg19.bed
